== 0.9.7 2011-01-12 (forked, me release)
* Removed ActiveSupport dependencies
* Removed hoe requirement, added rvideo.gemspec

== 0.9.6 2010-01-04 (forked, mhs release)

* Updated RVideo::Inspect#capture_frame to raise RVideo::TranscoderError::OuptutFileNotFound error when ffmpeg fails to extract a screenshot from a given movie.

* Updated inspector to support ffmpeg output from the macports ffmpeg.


== 0.9.5 2008-09-09
Note:
* Moving hosting to GitHub.
  http://github.com/zencoder/rvideo/tree

2 major enhancements:
* Large files, or some tools, would dump out so much output that it could run a server out of memory.
  Changed the way that output is parsed.  Instead of pulling it all into memory, the log file is sent to 
  disk, and then post-processed.
* Added support for yamdi (http://yamdi.sourceforge.net/) for FLV metadata injection.  This is much faster 
  than flvtool2 on huge files, and uses less memory as well.


== 0.9.4 2007-12-12

3 major enhancements:
* Changed transcoder interface. The preferred interface is now to pass the input file to RVideo::Transcoder.new. This allows you to create multiple output files from the same Transcoder object, and inspects the input file metadata before the job is transcoded.
* Added screengrab functionality to the Inspector class. Fire up an inspector instance on a file, and you can take one or more screenshots through inspected_file.capture_frame("50%").
* Added resolution/aspect support. Pass :width and :height parameters to a Transcoder instance, and include $resolution$ or $aspect_ratio$ in the recipe. 

4 minor enhancements:
* Remove old/unnecessary files and features
* Three additional ffmpeg results: unsupported codec and no output streams
* One additional flvtool2 result: empty input file
* Check that input file exists earlier in the transcoding process

== 0.9.3 2007-10-30

One minor enhancement:
* Reraise all unhandled RVideo exceptions as TranscoderErrors

== 0.9.2 2007-10-30

One minor bug fix:
* Correctly parse invalid files, where duration and bitrate are N/A, but start: 0.000 is included

== 0.9.1 2007-10-11

One major enhancement:
* Added Mencoder support. (Andre Medeiros)

Two minor enhancements: 
* Added total_time method to RVideo::Transcoder instances.
* Added another error condition for ffmpeg - codec not found.

Two notes:
* Tried and tested using open3 and open4 for command execution, but mencoder would unexpectedly hang with certain files when using these. Reverted these changes.
* Mencoder has basic unit tests, but needs more tests. In particular, example output should be added for a variety of cases (especially failures and errors).

== 0.9.0 2007-09-27

* Public RVideo release.

== 0.8.0 2007-09-27

* RVideo rewrite.
